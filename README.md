An Arduino library for interfacing with the **ACS772 Hall-effect Current Sensor**.  
This library reads the analog voltage output of the ACS772 and converts it into the measured current using the configured sensitivity.

1. Features
- Supports **ACS772 Hall-effect current sensors** (5A to 200A variants).  
- Converts **analog voltage to current (A)**.  
- Simple **initialization and reading API**.  
- Example sketches included for quick start.  
- Compatible with all Arduino boards (UNO, Mega, Leonardo, ESP32, etc).
